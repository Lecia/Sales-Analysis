# Sales-Analysis

### Project Overview

This repository contains the analysis for the BrightLight Data Analytics: Sales Case Study, based on a simulated dataset titled “Sales Case Study.csv”.
The dataset represents daily trading information for a single product sold at a large retail store.

Each record includes:

 - Date – Day of transaction
 - Sales – Total Rand value of sales
 - Cost of Sales – Total Rand value of the cost of sales
 - Quantity Sold – Total number of units sold

The goal of this project is to develop key metrics and extract meaningful insights about the sales performance of the product.

### Objectives

Using the dataset provided, this project focuses on:

 - Daily sales price per unit
 - Average unit sales price
 - Daily % gross profit
 - Daily % gross profit per unit
 - Promotional period analysis
 - Calculate Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)
 - Assess whether the product performs better or worse during promotions

Additional insights:

- Visualizations & Dashboards
- KPIs or any other relevant analysis

### Tools & Technologies Used

- Excel & Snowflake (SQL) – Data cleaning, formulas, pivot tables
- Power BI – Dashboards and visuals
- Python – Additional calculations and exploration
- GitHub – Version control and project documentation

### Key Calculations

 - Sales Price per Unit = Sales / Quantity Sold
 - Gross Profit = Sales – Cost of Sales
 - % Gross Profit = (Gross Profit / Sales) × 100
 - % Gross Profit per Unit = (Sales Price per Unit – Cost per Unit) / Sales Price per Unit
 - Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)
 - % Change in Quantity Sold ÷ % Change in Price
